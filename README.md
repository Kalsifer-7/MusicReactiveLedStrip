# MusicReactiveLedStrip

### A little script to make an addressable rgb led strip react to music with a microphone

## Requirements

- Arduino
> Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.
- Cables
> These might be Jumper wires to connect pins of the micro - controller.
 <br></br>
- Microphone
 > A microphone is a sensor or transducer which converts sound to electric signals.

- Addressable rgb led strip with [compatible chips](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference)

 > In addressable RGBs, each RGB LED (or segment/block of RGB LEDs) can display a different colour and intensity than its neighbours. Some could be lit in one colour or lit in another or more intense or less intense while others are simultaneously displaying something else.
